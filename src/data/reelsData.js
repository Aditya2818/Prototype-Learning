    title: "Definition of parallax and baseline concept",
    caption: "Parallax is the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from two different points. It helps scientists measure distances to nearby stars and objects in space. Baseline is the distance between the two observation points used to measure the parallax angle. A longer baseline gives a more accurate parallax angle and therefore a better distance estimate. Close one eye and look at your thumb, then switch eyes — your thumb appears to move. Your eyes act as the two observation points, and the distance between them is the baseline.",

Classical physics could not explain several key phenomena, such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect. To resolve this, Max Planck proposed that energy is not continuous but comes in small packets called quanta. Later, Albert Einstein used this idea to explain the photoelectric effect, suggesting that light behaves as both a wave and a particle — introducing the concept of photons. These discoveries challenged the classical understanding of matter and energy. Building on this, scientists like Niels Bohr introduced quantized atomic energy levels, Werner Heisenberg formulated the uncertainty principle, and Erwin Schrödinger developed a wave equation to describe the behavior of particles at the atomic scale. Together, these breakthroughs formed the foundation of quantum mechanics, a theory that governs the strange and probabilistic behavior of particles at the microscopic level and underpins much of modern physics and technology.",
